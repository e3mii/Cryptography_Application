# Cryptography Application 🛡️

A **Windows Forms demonstration application** that visually illustrates core cryptography concepts using C# and .NET.

This project was created for **study and demonstration purposes** to help understand both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography fundamentals.

---

## 🔐 Features

This application demonstrates:

- 🔑 **Symmetric Encryption (AES)**
  - Encrypt and decrypt data using Advanced Encryption Standard

- 🔐 **Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)**
  - Generate keys
  - Encrypt and decrypt using public/private key pair

- 🔎 **Hashing**
  - Compute cryptographic hashes for text

- ✍️ **Digital Signatures**
  - Sign messages and verify signatures

## 🧠 How It Works

This app uses the .NET `System.Security.Cryptography` library to show how cryptographic primitives work behind the scenes. It is designed for education, so EXPLANATIONS and REAL-WORLD use cases are shown alongside the code.
